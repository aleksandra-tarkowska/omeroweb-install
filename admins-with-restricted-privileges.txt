Administrators with restricted privileges
=========================================


Summary
-------

OMERO allows you to create administrators with a subset of the full
administrator privileges. This is a way to cater for the need for
more powerful users acting on behalf of all other OMERO users,
with no group allegiance but with access to all groups and data of
all users in OMERO. This should be achieved without creating new
full administrators in OMERO.
In the real world, these administrators with restricted privileges
(restricted admins) will typically be imaging
facility managers, image analysts, or anybody who needs to organize
users and data of others' in OMERO.

Full administrators in OMERO can create new administrators with
restricted privileges using the OMERO.web
interface, see :help:`create new users <sharing-data#admin>` chapter
of our Help documentation.

We suggest here four setups that should cover the four mainstream
workflows. Nevertheless, you can combine the privileges
(check the checkboxes in the OMERO.web interface)
in any way you see fit. The privilege were designed in such a way
that they still bear useful functionality even when used in
isolation. For example checking the :term:`Chown` checkbox will
indeed give the new administrator with restricted
privileges the power to transfer ownership of other users'
data with no other ifs and buts.

Y == privilege required, checkbox in OMERO.web interface is checked
N == privilege not required, checkbox is not checked
(O) == this privilege is suggested as optional for the workflow

.. note::
    **Restricted admins workflows in OMERO.clients:** Please do not
    expect for any workflows mentioned here that all OMERO.clients
    OMERO.web, OMERO.insight, command line interface (CLI)) are fully
    equipped to execute them (see details below). New features will
    be added in OMERO.clients in the 5.3.x series of OMERO releases.

.. note::
    **Group allegiances** All the workflows here do not assume that
    the administrator with restricted privileges is not a member of
    any group except the System group. This does not preclude such
    administrator from being a member of any number of groups.
    Inside the groups the restricted admin is a member of, he/she
    has the same privileges as other group members of that group
    additionally to his/her adminstrative privileges.

.. note::
    **Deleting privileges**: :term:`Sudo` privilege has implicitly
    in itself a Delete power over the data the administrator is
    sudoed in as. If you want to prevent restricted admin from
    Deleting of others' data entirely, do not give :term:`Delete Data`
    AND do not give :term:`Sudo` privileges.

.. note::
    **Privilege escalation**: The administrator with restricted privileges
    (restricted admin) are prevented from escalation of their privileges.
    Creation of a restricted admin with higher privileges than the creator
    or creation of a full administrator are prevented. Furthermore, although
    a restricted admin can Sudo on behalf of a full administrator, their
    privileges will not expand to the full administrator privilege set
    by this action. See also :term:`Sudo`.

.. _Workflow 1:

Workflow 1: Data viewer
-----------------------
Even if you do not give any explicit privileges to the administrator with
restricted privileges, this new administrator has some useful powers.
These include browsing and viewing all the data of all users in all
groups (including the groups where he/she is not a member).
The administrator with restricted privileges
is also able to Download all the data in all types of groups.
Further, he/she can view user and group information, such as usernames,
e-mail addresses, group permission levels and lists of all users
and groups. He/she is not able to annotate, edit or delete any of the
data or change any user or group informations though. Note that any
administrator with restricted privileges described below or otherwise
created combining the privileges at will would be able to perform the
Data viewer workflow as well.

Workflow 1: Data viewer in clients:

- OMERO.insight: is not designed to show any groups or data you are not
  a member of. The Data Viewer workflow is preferably
  executed using OMERO.web or CLI

- OMERO.web: viewing and downloading the data,
  see :help:`Viewing Data <viewing-data>`

- CLI: listing all images, groups and users, download::

    # List all users on server
    $ bin/omero user list
    # List all groups on server
    $ bin/omero group list
    # List all images on server
    $ bin/omero fs images

.. _Workflow 2:

Workflow 2: Importer
--------------------
The Importer's task is to import images into OMERO for other users,
i.e. in such a manner that the imported images are owned by the users
in OMERO, not by the Importer. This is typically an imaging facility
manager who is importing data acquired by users on microscopes into OMERO.

Importer workflow can be achieved fully with only the :term:`Sudo`
privilege (first line in the above table). This privilege allows them
factically to "become" the user they are importing the data for.
There might be reasons though why the Importer needs to re-organize
the imported data. For example, he/she made a mistake, Sudoed as
a wrong user in a wrong group and needs to rectify the mistake using
the command line interface (CLI) client. Whilst being sudoed, the
Importer can Delete the wrongly imported data (even without Delete
privilege given, see the Note above), logout, login and :term:`Sudo` as
the correct user and repeat the import process. In short, whilst Sudoed,
Importer can do any action which the user he/she is sudoed in as is
allowed to do too. In case any more post-import cleaning and data
organizing is necessary for Importer, this might be enabled by giving
him/her also privilege necessary for Data
organizer (see :ref:`Workflow 4` below).

If you have any doubts about giving the administrators with restricted
privilege the :term:`Sudo` privilege (which gives the ability to delete
users' data), there are 2 workarounds which enable Importer
to achieve import for others without :term:`Sudo`.

The first workaround involves importing the data as Importer into the
group of the future data owner and then trasferring the ownership of the
data (see details in :ref:`Workflow 3`: Analyst). The second
workaround involves importing into the group of the Importer as the
importer, then moving the data into the group of the future data owner
and then changing the ownership of the data to the owner (necessary
tools are described in :ref:`Workflow 4`: Group and Data Organizer).

Workflow 2: Importer in clients:

- OMERO.importer or OMERO.insight: You have to be a member of the group
  you want to import to in OMERO.importer or OMERO.insight. Login as the
  administrator with restricted privileges and perform the import for
  others as described in the chapter of Help documentation
  :help:`import for others <facility-manager#import>`.

- CLI: (see also the videos on import on
  `OME YouTube channel
  <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyySB9ZzNi8aBGYqcxSrauQ>`_)::

    # Login as the Importer and sudo as the user you want to import for
    $ bin/omero --sudo Importer -u user login
    # Create new containers belonging to the user
    $ bin/omero obj new Dataset name=Dataset-of-user
    $ bin/omero obj new Project name=Project-of-user
    # Link the containers
    $ bin/omero obj new ProjectDatasetLink parent=Project:17 child=Dataset:13
    # Import into created Dataset
    $ bin/omero import ~/Desktop/CMPO1.png -T Dataset:name:Dataset-of-user

.. _Workflow 3:

Workflow 3: Analyst
-------------------
Typically, Analyst in OMERO needs to

- read the data (always possible, see :ref:`Workflow 1`: Data viewer)
- change and save the rendering settings of the images (enabled by
  :term:`Write Data` privilege, exception is
  Private groups, where he/she cannot save Rnd settings)
- annotate the data (enabled by :term:`Write Data` privilege, but not
  possible in Private groups)
- draw and save ROIs on other users' images (enabled by :term:`Write Data`
  privilege, but no saving in Private groups possible)
- upload and attaching of result files to the analyzed images (enabled by
  :term:`Write Data` privilege, except Private groups, where attaching
  is not possible)
- create Projects and Datasets for newly imported images in groups he/she
  is not a member of (enabled by :term:`Write Data` privilege)
- import new images resulting from image analysis into these containers
  (enabled by :term:`Write Data` privilege)
- (possibly) changing the ownership of the newly created conainers and
  contained result images to the users (enabled by :term:`Chown` privilege)
- upload, edit and delete official scripts usable by all OMERO users
  (enabled by :term:`Upload Scripts` privilege)

Workflow 3: Analyst in clients:

- OMERO.insight or Insight-ImageJ plugin: Analyst has to be a member of the
  group where the data is. Can draw ROIs and extract analysis results from
  the ROIs and data in any type of group. Can save ROIs except in Private
  groups. Can upload official scripts in OMERO.insight (any group type,
  Analyst does not have to be a member of
  any particular group for script upload).

- OMERO.web, OMERO.insight, Insight-ImageJ plugin: Analyst can adjust
  rendering settings and save them, upload
  attachments with results, annotate (for example tag, key-value pairs,
  rating, commenting). All works except in Private groups when done on
  images belonging to others. See :help:`rendering <managing-data#rendering>`,
  :help:`annotating <managing-data#annotating>`,
  :help:`attaching files <managing-data#attach>`,
  :help:`attaching data <managing-data#attach>`.

- CLI: Upload of official scripts (any group type,
  see :doc:`/developers/scripts/user-guide` and below),
  upload of attachments with results, annotating
  (not in private group), creating containers, import of resulting images
  into groups you are not a member of, and transferring ownership of these
  containers (any group type), transferring ownership of objects
  (annotation, ROI, uploaded attachment with results)::

    # Upload an official script
    $ bin/omero script upload --official /PATH/TO?YOUR_SCRIPT
    # Login to the group the original data are in
    $ bin/omero -g testgroup login
    # Create new Dataset
    $ bin/omero obj new Dataset name=new-dataset
    # Import result images into the Dataset
    $ bin/omero import -T Dataset:name:new-dataset /PATH/TO/RESULT/IMAGES
    # Transfer the ownership of the Dataset and
    # of the contained images to the user with ID:55
    $ bin/omero chown 55 Dataset:112

.. _Workflow 4:

Workflow 4: Group and Data Organizer
------------------------------------
Group and Data Organizer is a role of someone tasked with creation of new
users and groups in OMERO and allocating the users to appropriate groups
(also able to change the users' information such as e-mail and change
group permissions level). These tasks are facilitated by the privileges
:term:`Create and Edit Groups`,
:term:`Create and Edit Users` and :term:`Add Users to Groups`.

Group and Data Organizer might also be tasked with dealing with data left
after OMERO users which left the institution. Organizer can transfer of
ownership of the data of the leaving person (facilitated by :term:`Chown`
privilege) to another user. Possibly, the new owner of the data is not a
member of the data group. In such case, Organizer first moves the data
between groups (facilitated by :term:`Chgrp` privilege), only then
transfers the ownership of the data. Always try to avoid the situation
where owner of the data is not in data group.

For moving data between groups, usage of OMERO.web is highly recommended.
Organizer can create new containers (Projects, Datasets) on behalf of data
owner in OMERO.web conveniently as part of Move to Group command in OMERO.
web (link to Move to Group in Help). The containers and links of data to
containers will belong to data owner. For new container creation and
linking, :term:`Write Data` privilege is necessary.

In case of data owner not being in the group where the data is,
Organizer can also add the new data owner to the
data group (facilitated by :term:`Add Users to Groups` privilege),
instead of moving the data. Organizer transfers the ownership of the data
to the new owner only after he/she has added the new
data owner to the data group.

During all data manipulation steps, Organizer needs :term:`Write Data`
privilege to create new Projects or Datasets for the new owners of the
data and make the linking of the data to those containers or to already
existing containers of the new owner. Note that any links created by
Organizer will belong to the Organizer, not the owner of the data. This
will be addressed in OMERO.web in the 5.3.x series. The ownership transfer
of the containers and links can be done later on the CLI. Linking of
others' data is never possible in Private groups.

After the Organizer dealt with the data, he/she can remove the leaving
person from any group (included in :term:`Add Users to Groups` privilege)
and make the user inactive (facilitated by :term:`Create and Edit Users`
privilege).

Note that the ownership of data of a user can be trasferred either
piecemeal, i.e. specifying each Project or Dataset to transfer (using
``omero chown`` command of CLI), or all data of the user can be
transferred in one step (this function is availabel in API and will appear
in OMERO clients in the 5.3.x series of OMERO).

Quite naturally the Group and Data Organizer can be easily split into two
separate roles, Group Organizer (with :term:`Create and Edit Groups`,
:term:`Create and Edit Users`, :term:`Add Users to Groups` privileges)
and Data Organizer (:term:`Write Data`, :term:`Delete Data`, :term:`Chgrp`,
:term:`Chown`). Of course, again, another pick and mix of these privileges
is also possible as you see fit. The only recommendation here is: In case
of assumed usage of OMERO.web client for Group and User organization by the
new Organizer, give always all three :term:`Create and Edit Groups`,
:term:`Create and Edit Users`, :term:`Add Users to Groups` privileges to
prevent poor experience in the OMERO.web client.
This issue will be addressed in the 5.3.x series.

Workflow 4: Group and Data Organizer in clients:

- OMERO.web: All the Data Organizing actions possible, except transfer
  of ownership (possible only in CLI, will be addressed in the 5.3.x
  series). All the Group Organizing actions possible if all
  :term:`Create and Edit Groups`, :term:`Create and Edit Users` and
  :term:`Add Users to Groups` are given.

- CLI: Moving data between groups not recommended in CLI because of the need
  of being a member of target group, other features see below::

    # Create new user and put him into 2 groups
    $ bin/omero user add username firstname lastname group1 group2
    # Edit login name of a user with ID:55
    $ bin/omero obj update Experimenter:55 omeName=new-login-name
    # Add a user to a group named "testgroup"
    $ bin/omero group adduser --name testgroup --user-name newbieingroup
    $ bin/omero group removeuser --name testgroup --user-name thegoner
    # Make a user a group owner. Works also when the ownertobe
    # is already a member of the group
    $ bin/omero group adduser --name group --user-name ownertobe --as-owner
    # Remove a group owner from ownership of the group. Does not remove
    # the formerowner from group, just unsets the ownership. This works fine
    # with Create and Edit Group privilege only
    $ bin/omero user leavegroup testgroup --name formerowner  --as-owner
    # Transfer ownership to user 55 of the whole hierarchy of the Project 112
    # including the links, as long as all the objects and links in the
    # hierarchy belong to the same user
    $ bin/omero chown 55 Project:112
    # Transfer the ownership of a Project-Dataset link. Useful in case the
    # link was created by the Organizer and links objects of others'
    $ bin/omero chown 55 ProjectDatasetLink:123
    # Transfer the ownership of Dataset-Image link
    $ bin/omero chown 55 DatasetImageLink:154

    Sudo
        Administrator can log in as another user, with all the permissions
        of that user. When the restricted admin is working on
        behalf of a user and using Sudo, their privileges are a common least
        denominator of the privileges of the user and of the restricted
        admin. See also Note on privilege escalation,
        Note on Delete and :ref:`Workflow 2` for more details.

    Write Data
        Administrator can create data in groups of which he/she is not
        a member. Also allows annotating, adding attachments to and editing
        and linking of other users' data.
        See :ref:`Workflow 3` for more details.

    Delete Data
        Administrator can delete other users' data. See Note on Delete
        for more details. Integral part of :ref:`Workflow 4`.

    Chgrp
        Administrator can move others' data to a different Group.
        See :ref:`Workflow 4` for more details.

    Chown
        Administrator can transfer others' data to a different Owner.
        See :ref:`Workflow 4` for more details.

    Create and Edit Groups
        Administrator can create and edit groups (but not add or
        remove users). See :ref:`Workflow 4` for more details.

    Create and Edit Users
        Administrator can create and edit other users (but not add
        them to groups). See :ref:`Workflow 4` for more details.

    Add Users to Groups
        Administrator can add or remove users to groups. 
        See :ref:`Workflow 4` for more details.

    Upload Scripts
        Administrator can upload "official" OMERO.scripts to the server.
        See :ref:`Workflow 3` for more details.

    Data Viewer
        Administrator who views and downloads data of others.
        See more details in :ref:`Workflow 1`.

    Importer
        Administrator who imports images into OMERO for other users.
        The imported images are owned by the users in OMERO, not by
        the Importer. This is typically an imaging facility manager
        who is importing data acquired by users on microscopes into OMERO.
        See more details in :ref:`Workflow 2`.

    Analyst
        Administrator who performs image analysis on others' images in OMERO.
        See more details in :ref:`Workflow 3`.

    Group and Data Organizer
        Administrator who creates new users and groups in OMERO and allocates
        or removes the users to or from appropriate groups. This
        administrator also deals with data left after OMERO users which left
        the institution, or otherwise is tasked with re-organizing of others'
        data. See more details in :ref:`Workflow 4`.
