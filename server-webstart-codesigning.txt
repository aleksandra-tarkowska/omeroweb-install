Insight webstart security and code-signing
==========================================

Java 1.7 and later includes strict security settings which prevent Java web
applications from running unless they are signed with a code-signing
certificate. This includes the Insight webstart client included with
OMERO.server.

All current OMERO.server releases are code-signed by the University of Dundee.
If you build and distribute your own copies of OMERO and want to use Insight
webstart you can either change the :ref:`Java security settings for all users
<server_webstart_client_configuration>`, or buy a code-signing certificate and
use this to :ref:`sign the client <server_webstart_codesign>`.


.. _server_webstart_client_configuration:

Java configuration settings
---------------------------

Add a security exception in the Java Control Panel (on Windows this can be
accessed through the Control Panel, on Mac OS X through System Preferences).

Code-signing your own server
----------------------------

First buy a code-signing certificate from a certifcate authority. Note that
several types of certificate are available, ensure you buy one suitable for
signing Java code. If necessary convert the certificate to PKCS #12 format and
create a JKS certificate store.

The server can be signed using the :source:`omero_insight_sign.py
<docs/hudson/omero_insight_sign.py>` script, for example::

    omero_insight_sign.py <keystore.jks> <alias> OMERO.server-XXX.zip \
        -kp <keystore-password> -cp <certificate-password> \
        -ts <timestamping-yes-no> -oz <OMERO.server-XXX-signed.zip>

See the script for more information.
