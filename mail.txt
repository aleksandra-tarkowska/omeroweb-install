OMERO.mail
==========

The OMERO server has the ability to send email to any users who have a properly
configured email address. OMERO system administrators can then use the
:omerocmd:`admin email` command to contact those users.

In order to activate the subsystem, minimally the :property:`omero.mail.config`
property will need to be activated.

Minimum configuration
---------------------

::

    $ bin/omero config set omero.mail.config true

By default, this will use "localhost" as the mail server on port 25 and send as
the user "omero". Likely you will need to configure OMERO to use your actual mail server.

For example,

::

    $ bin/omero config set omero.mail.host smtp.university.example

If authentication is required, then also configure:

::

    $ bin/omero config set omero.mail.username USER
    $ bin/omero config set omero.mail.password PASS

Further configuration
---------------------

TBD
