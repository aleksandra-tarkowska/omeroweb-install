Server installation on Windows
==============================

.. warning:: OMERO 5.2 is the last major version which will feature Windows
    support for OMERO.server and OMERO.web deployment. See
    `this blog post <http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/future-plans/deployment/2016/03/22/windows-support/>`_ for details. If you are installing a new server, we highly
    recommend you use a different OS (see
    :doc:`/sysadmins/version-requirements`).
