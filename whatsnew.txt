What's new for OMERO 5.1
========================

From a sysadmin's point of view, here is some introductory / overview
text.

- :doc:`server-upgrade` has **not yet** been updated to explain the
  server upgrade process from OMERO 5.0 to OMERO 5.1.

- :doc:`system-requirements` has been updated to reflect **various
  things yet to be finalized**.

- A new configuration property :property:`omero.graphs.wrap` allows
  switching back to the old server code for moving and deleting data. If
  a regression with the new code requires changing this setting, ensure
  that a bug is filed with the OME team so it can be fixed before this
  configuration property is *removed* in OMERO 5.2.


OMERO.web
---------

- OMERO.web now defaults to being mounted at the root on all webservers with
  the exception of IIS (Windows production deployment) where it continues to
  be mounted on ``/omero``. Static files continue to be served from
  ``/static``. :ref:`Both prefixes can be customized
  <customizing_your_omero_web_installation_unix>` (including on IIS) but note
  the configuration property :property:`omero.web.force_script_name` has
  changed to :property:`omero.web.prefix`.

- :ref:`Apache 2.4 with mod_proxy_fcgi <apache24_configuration>` is now
  supported.

- OMERO.web FastCGI processes default to listening on 127.0.0.1 instead of
  all network interfaces. This improves security, see
  :ref:`customizing_your_omero_web_installation_unix` if you need to listen
  on another interface.

- If OMERO.web is disabled the generated Nginx and Apache configurations
  automatically display a maintenance page.
