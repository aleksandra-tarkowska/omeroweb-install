What's new for OMERO 5
======================

From a sysadmin's point of view, the introduction of OMERO.fs as part of
version 5.0 means that files are now stored on the server in their original
format, preserving file names and directory structures. Therefore, the import
process does not duplicate pixel data and storage requirements are roughly
halved in comparison with a 4.4 import including archiving the original files.
Combined with the new file integrity report, you should be confident that once
a successful import has taken place, storing the original files outside of
OMERO is no longer necessary as your users can always download their data in
its original format if they need to.

- :doc:`server-upgrade` has been updated to explain the server upgrade
  process from 4.4.x to OMERO 5, and also to describe the introduction of
  password salting support.

- :doc:`fs-upload-configuration` has been added to explain the server-side FS
  workflow for importing files.

- :doc:`dropbox` has been reworked to clarify the distinction between OMERO.fs
  and OMERO.dropbox.

- :doc:`system-requirements` has been updated to reflect that running
  OMERO.web on your server now requires Python 2.6.5 or later.
