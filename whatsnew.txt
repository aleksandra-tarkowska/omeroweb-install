What's new for OMERO 5
======================

- **Upgrading from OMERO 4.4.x to OMERO 5 is now possible**;
  :doc:`server-upgrade` has been updated to explain the server upgrade
  process, and also to describe the introduction of password salting support.

- :doc:`fs-upload-configuration` has been added to explain the server-side FS
  workflow for importing files.

- :doc:`dropbox` has been reworked to clarify the distinction between OMERO.fs
  and OMERO.dropbox.

- :doc:`system-requirements` has been updated to reflect that running 
  OMERO.web on your server now requires Python 2.6.5 or later.
