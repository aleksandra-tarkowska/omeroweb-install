What's new for OMERO 5.2 for sysadmins
======================================

- OMERO clients are no longer distributed as Java Web Start applications. This
  decision is discussed at length in our `Java Web Start blog post <http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/future-plans/2015/09/23/java-web-start/>`_.
  We recognize that this will be problematic for some institutional users and
  are working to expand the functionality of OMERO.web to mitigate this as far
  as possible.

- The :doc:`version-requirements` section provides extensive
  details about which operating systems and dependency versions we intend to
  support for the life of 5.2 and the likely changes to these for the next
  major release (currently planned to be 5.3). Most notably, we have dropped
  support for Java 1.6 and changed the Python dependencies.

- The OMERO.web framework no longer bundles a copy of the Django package,
  instead manual installation of the Django dependency is required. It is
  highly recommended to use `Django 1.8`_ (LTS) which requires Python 2.7.
  For more information see :ref:`python-requirements` on the
  :doc:`/sysadmins/version-requirements` page.

- FastCGI support was removed in OMERO 5.2 and OMERO.web can be deployed
  using WSGI :ref:`omero_web_deployment`.

- The configuration property :property:`omero.graphs.wrap` which allowed
  switching back to the old server code for moving and deleting data has now
  been removed. You must migrate to using the new request operations.

- Add support for Ice 3.6. With Ice 3.6, the Python bindings are provided separately.
  This allows to install the RPM packages provided by ZeroC.
  Then run ``pip install zeroc-ice`` to install the Ice Python bindings if
  your package manager does not provide the Ice python packages.
