What's new for OMERO 5.2 for sysadmins
======================================

- OMERO clients are no longer distributed as Java Web Start applications. This
  decision is discussed at length in our `Java Web Start blog post <http://blog.openmicroscopy.org/tech-issues/future-plans/2015/09/23/java-web-start/>`_.
  We recognize that this will be problematic for some institutional users and
  are working to expand the functionality of OMERO.web to mitigate this as far
  as possible.

- The configuration property :property:`omero.graphs.wrap` which allowed
  switching back to the old server code for moving and deleting data has now
  been removed. You must migrate to using the new request operations.
