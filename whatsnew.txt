What's new for OMERO 5.1
========================

- :doc:`version-requirements` provides extensive details about which operating
  systems and dependency versions we will be supporting for the life of 5.1
  and the likely changes to these for the next major release (currently slated
  to be 5.2). :doc:`system-requirements` has been updated to reflect these
  updates.

- A new configuration property :property:`omero.graphs.wrap` allows
  switching back to the old server code for moving and deleting data. If
  a regression with the new code requires changing this setting, ensure
  that a bug is filed with the OME team so it can be fixed before this
  configuration property is *removed* in OMERO 5.2.

- OMERO 5.1 requires a Unicode-encoded (UTF8) database, the
  :doc:`server-upgrade` page has been updated to reflect this.

.. _web-breaking-changes:

OMERO.web
---------

- OMERO.web now defaults to being mounted at the root on all webservers with
  the exception of IIS (Windows production deployment) where it continues to
  be mounted on ``/omero``. Static files continue to be served from
  ``/static``. :ref:`Both prefixes can be customized
  <customizing_your_omero_web_installation_unix>` (including on IIS) but note
  the configuration property :property:`omero.web.force_script_name` has
  changed to :property:`omero.web.prefix`.

- :ref:`Apache 2.4 with mod_proxy_fcgi <apache24_configuration>` is now
  supported.

- OMERO.web FastCGI processes default to listening on 127.0.0.1 instead of
  all network interfaces. This improves security, see
  :ref:`customizing_your_omero_web_installation_unix` if you need to listen
  on another interface.

- If OMERO.web is disabled the generated Nginx and Apache configurations
  automatically display a maintenance page.

- The semantics of the command for generating the Nginx configuration has
  been modified as described below:

  .. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1

    * - Version
      - 5.0.x command
      - 5.1.x command
    * - System configuration
      - ``omero web config nginx --system``
      - ``omero web config nginx``
    * - User configuration
      - ``omero web config nginx``
      - ``omero web config nginx-development``

OMERO.mail
----------

A new :doc:`additional feature <advanced-install>` has been added. :doc:`mail`
allows you to configure the server to email users, for example to alert group
owners to broken links in OMERO.web.
