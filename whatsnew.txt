What's new for OMERO 5.1
========================

From a sysadmin's point of view, here is some introductory / overview
text.

- :doc:`server-upgrade` has **not yet** been updated to explain the
  server upgrade process from OMERO 5.0 to OMERO 5.1.

- :doc:`system-requirements` has been updated to reflect **various
  things yet to be finalized**.

- A new configuration property :property:`omero.graphs.wrap` allows
  switching back to the old server code for moving and deleting data. If
  a regression with the new code requires changing this setting, ensure
  that a bug is filed with the OME team so it can be fixed before this
  configuration property is *removed* in OMERO 5.2.
