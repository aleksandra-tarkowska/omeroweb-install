Proposal for revised minimum version requirements
-------------------------------------------------

Minimum software versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is a proposal to the wider community to solicit their
feedback. For each component, we need to decide upon the minumum
supportable version which is provided by a distribution and/or is
installable independently. Criteria for what is considered to be
supportable includes support by its developers upstream and within
each operating system distribution for the lifetime of the 5.1 release
(including security support), and also upon our resources allocated to
CI and testing.  If we aren't actively testing it, we can't claim it's
supported or functional.

Proposed changes are made for both the forthcoming 5.1 release, and
also for the following 5.2 release, albeit tentatively at this point,
in order that sysadmins may plan ahead and ensure that prerequisites
are in place to ease future upgrades.

As a system administrator, your feedback regarding these proposed
changes would be most appreciated.  We would like to ensure that we
support deployment and upgrade of OMERO on the most commonly-used and
supported Linux and Windows releases, and also on MacOS X, with a
minimum of effort.  If any of the proposed changes will be problematic
(for example, the minimum requirement for a given component is not
possible to meet), please do provide us with the details of your
system so that we can consider this in future revisions to this
proposal before the requirements are made final.  Please check the
minimum Java and PostgreSQL versions in particular.

Note that the following section contains the details which were used
to create this proposal.

Operating systems
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

* Microsoft Windows

  * Proposal: [5.1] 7 (client) / Server 2008R2 (server)
  * Proposal: [5.2] raise minimum to 8 (client) / Server 2012R2
    (server) if needed
  * Rationale: All prior versions prior to this are/will be out of
    support shortly except Vista (which we don't test and is not
    widely used). We have no testing of these older systems.

* MacOS X

  * Proposal: [5.1] 10.8
  * Proposal: [5.2] 10.9
  * Proposal: Support 10.8 for client only, test server only on
    10.9/10.10
  * Rationale: All prior versions no longer have security support and
    it still leaves 3 versions to support. MacOS X is typically suited
    only to client use, not serious server deployment

* Linux (CentOS/RHEL)

  * Proposal: [5.1] 6.x
  * Proposal: [5.2] Recommend 7.x over 6.x; 6.x will either remain
    supported or become unsupported
  * Rationale: 7 is quite new and not yet widely adopted, and so it's
    likely many institutions will wish to continue using 6 for the
    foreseeable future. However, the versions in 6 are getting quite
    old and this does affect the support for other components (see
    below)

* Linux (Ubuntu LTS)

  * Proposal: [5.1] 12.04 supported, 14.04 recommended
  * Proposal: [5.2] 12.04 dropped, 14.04 recommended
  * Proposal: Only LTS versions are supported and tested. Non-LTS
    versions following a supported LTS release are likely to work but
    are not officially supported or tested.
  * Rationale: Both are newer than CentOS/RHEL 6.x, so both could be
    supported since all version requirements are satisfied. However,
    14.04 comes with Ice 3.5 and is generally more up to date, and we
    don't have testing in place for either at present. We do not have
    the resources to test non-LTS versions, though recent releases are
    in use by developers.

* Linux (Debian)

  * Proposal: [5.1] 7 recommended, 6 dropped
  * Proposal: [5.2] 8 recommended, 7 supported
  * Rationale: 6 is older than Ubuntu 12.04 and only has Ice 3.3;
    extended support will be present for the 5.1 lifetime however so
    will be usable if Ice is upgraded, but will not have official
    support.

Bitness
,,,,,,,

Currently 32- and 64-bit systems are supported for client and server
on all platforms with the exception of MacOS X (64-bit only).

* Proposal: [5.1] Drop 32-bit support for server, retain 32-bit
  support for clients
* Proposal: [5.2] Drop 32-bit support entirely
* Rationale: It’s not practical to run a server on a 32-bit system due
  to its memory requirements, so it’s safe to drop 32-bit support for
  5.1 given that it’s de-facto 64-bit-only today. There are still a
  number of 32-bit Windows clients, so support should probably be
  retained. However, new systems are almost all 64-bit so dropping
  32-bit support is a possibility for 5.2.

Components
,,,,,,,,,,

* PostgreSQL

  * Proposal: [5.1] 9.2 recommended, 9.3+ supported, 8.4 dropped, 9.0
    and 9.1 also dropped
  * Proposal: [5.2] 9.3 recommended, 9.4+ supported, 9.2 supported or
    dropped
  * Rationale: Current releases available for all supported systems
    from upstream and for CentOS/RHEL 6.x officially via SCL (software
    collections). At a bare minimum, 8.4 and 9.0 must be dropped (end
    of security support); dropping 9.1 removes the floating point
    issues fixed by 9.2+. Due to its age, 8.4 no longer receives
    adequate testing and so we can’t claim to support it. The same
    applies to 9.0 and 9.1.

* Python

  * Proposal: [5.1] 2.7 recommended, 2.6 supported, (3.x not
    supported)
  * Proposal: [5.2] 2.7 recommended, 2.6 dropped, (3.x not supported)
  * Rationale: 2.7 is provided by all systems except for
    CentOS/RHEL 6.x, however it is available officially via SCL so
    could be made the minimum. Note that 3.3 is also available via
    SCL, so there's potential for a 3.x migration in the 5.2
    timeframe. Dropping 2.6 would unify python support to a single
    major version, and remove a number of portability issues; now it's
    restricted to CentOS/RHEL 6, it's in practice much less tested than
    2.7 since no developer is using it routinely. Removing 2.6 support
    will be dependent upon internal testing of the SCL python in
    CentOS.

* GCC

  * Proposal: [5.1] 4.4
  * Proposal: [5.2] Depends upon CentOS6 and Ubuntu 12.04 support
    status
  * Rationale: 4.4 is the CentOS/RHEL 6.x default. It would be
    desirable to update but is probably not what external users will
    want given the compatibility concerns. The SCL DeveloperToolset3
    could bring this up to GCC 4.9.1, which would make the new
    baseline GCC 4.6 (Ubuntu 12.04 and Travis)

* LLVM/clang

  * Proposal: 3.4 
  * Rationale: It's the current toolchain on MacOS/FreeBSD and is
    working well; 3.3 dropped due to no longer being used by current
    toolchains

* MSVC

  * Proposal: [5.1] 2010
  * Proposal: [5.2] 2012
  * Rationale: The minimum (and maximum) MSVC version is determined by
    the Windows Ice builds provided by ZeroC, and as such is limited
    by our Ice version requirements. Raising the limit in 5.2 will
    permit use of newer language features.

* Ice

  * Proposal: [5.1] 3.4 supported, 3.5 recommended, 3.6 likely not
    supported
  * Proposal: [5.2] 3.4 dropped, 3.5 supported, 3.6 recommended
    (subject to testing)
  * Rationale: 3.4 is no longer supported by ZeroC with 3.5 being
    current. By the release of 5.2, Ice 3.6 will have been out for
    some time and should be well tested.

* Java

  * Proposal: [5.1] 7 recommended, 8 supported, 6 dropped
  * Proposal: [5.2] 7 supported, 8 recommended
  * Rationale: It's 2 years this Februrary since the last Java 6
    security update. Java 7 is supported on all supported operating
    systems above, and in most cases is the default java version on
    those systems (it’s now 8 on some). This was mentioned recently,
    and also by the Fiji developers; 5.1 would be an opportune time to
    drop Java 6. Also note that we no longer actively test with a Java
    6 JVM; all internal testing is on Java 7 or 8 (Oracle and
    OpenJDK), and there are some client issues with OpenJDK6

* Apache

  * Proposal: [5.1] 2.2
  * Rationale: 2.2 is the CentOS/RHEL 6.x and Ubuntu 12.04
    version. 2.4 support in OMERO isn't perfect at this point, needing
    some manual tweaking (should be resolved for 5.1)

* nginx

  * Proposal: [5.1] 1.0
  * Proposal: [5.2] 1.4
  * Rationale: All versions work; 1.0 is the Ubuntu 12.04 version, 1.4
    is the Ubuntu 14.04 and Debian 8 version.

XP is now unsupported upstream, and Server 2003 will be unsupported
within the timeframe of 5.1 support.  Vista is likely supported but
usage is minimal and it is untested, hence marked as dropped.  7/Server
2008 and 8/Server 2012 are both supported and used.  Server 2008
builds in place; no 2012 builds or testing in place yet.  No regular
Windows CI deployment and testing is in place other than manually.
Some manual testing on Windows 7 VMs and machines.

Apple do not formally announce end of life for their releases, but 10.6
security fixes ended some time back, and 10.7 has now also ended with
the release of 10.10.  We have regular CI testing of 10.8, 10.9 and
10.10 builds plus developer testing of building and client and server
deployment.  10.6 and 10.7 are marked as dropped since we no longer
use 10.6 internally, and never used 10.7, and they are no longer
tested by the CI infrastructure (all 10.6 and 10.7 nodes retired).

UNIX (FreeBSD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It only really makes sense to support the base toolchain for major
releases and the Ports tree (which is continually updated); these will
be covered in the dependencies, below.

Linux (Centos and RHEL)

Only RHEL and CentOS 6 are supported at present.  Given the long life
of enterprise releases, I'd suggest we should only support the latest
one at any given time or else it ties us into very old dependencies;
6.x is already quite long in the tooth, however is in wide use and so
will require supporting for 5.1 at a minimum.  7.x can be the
recommended version once it is properly tested by us and has
appropriate CI support.  There is currently extensive CI support for
building and deployment with CentOS 6 but it is not used directly by
developers in general.

Linux (Fedora)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`General overview <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle>`__

Due to the fast pace of Fedora development, it only really makes sense
to support the current and perhaps the previous release; these will be
covered in the dependencies, below.

Only the LTS releases are supported due to resource limitations upon
CI and testing.  Only the last two LTS releases are supported (being a
bit more frequent than CentOS/RHEL).  There is currently no CI testing
for any version, but some developer use of 12.04 LTS, 14.04 LTS and
more recent non-LTS releases.

Stable releases 7.x and 6.x are supported.  There is no CI testing for
any version, and some developer use of 7.x.

Linux (Debian testing and unstable)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the fast pace of Debian developement, it only really makes
sense to support the last one or two stable releases; the testing and
unstable requirements will be covered in the dependencies, below.

Hardware support
----------------


Microsoft Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit) for all supported
versions; most systems are today running x64 with most hardware being
x64, but there is still a niche of x86 users, estimated <25% and
falling globally (OMERO usage stats here?)

Unix (MacOS X)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently all supported versions are amd64 (64-bit) only.

Unix (FreeBSD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit) for all supported
releases.  Other platforms are supported, but may require manual
building of prerequisites.

Linux (RHEL and CentOS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 6 supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit).  Version 7
supports amd64 (64-bit) only.

Linux (other)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most distributions support i386 / x86 (32-bit) as well, while some
support additional architectures such as 32-bit and/or 64-bit arm and
powerpc.

Additional notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OMERO server is 64-bit-only due to the large memory requirements.
On the client side, there is a requirement for 32-bit support for
Windows clients and to a lesser extent on Linux, and zero on MacOS X
at present.  Dropping 32-bit support for OMERO.server and C++ Ice and
other builds should be considered, given the vast reduction in the
support burden and steadily dropping need for these builds.

Dependencies
------------

The following subsections detail the versions of each dependency
needed by OMERO which are supported by both its upstream developers
(for security and general updates) and by OME for OMERO building and
server and client deployment.

.. note::
    Versions in brackets are in development distributions and may
    change without notice.

The PostgreSQL project provides `packages
<http://www.postgresql.org/download/>`__ for supported platforms.
Therefore distribution support is not critical since 9.3 and 9.4 are
available for all platforms.

At the moment 2.7 support is present upstream for the foreseeable
future; 3.x versions continue to be released and retired regularly in
parallel.  The limiting factor will be distribution support for 2.7 as
major packages are slowly switching to 3.x, and this might leave us in
a mess if our python module dependencies are no longer available
without major effort.  Ice in particular has dropped 2.7 support for
Windows.

Note that clang++ 3.3 is used in MacOS 10.8 and FreeBSD 10; earlier
versions were not much used as a default compiler and are probably not
worth supporting; 3.4 is used in MacOS X 10.9 and 10.10 and in FreeBSD
10.1. Until 3.4, no point releases were made for major versions.

The version to use is largely dependent upon the Ice support for a particular Visual Studio version.

- Ice 3.5 supports 2013, 2012 and 2010
- Ice 3.4 supports 2010 and 2008

In general later versions have better C++ standards conformance and
correctness, and should be preferred where possible.

Note that all distributions provide OpenJDK 6, 7 and/or 8 due to
distribution restrictions by Oracle.  Oracle Java may be used if
downloaded separately.

Oracle no longer allow general downloading of Java 6.  Java 7 is
available for all platforms except for OSX 10.6 (where it is
installable manually by unpacking the 10.7 installer).  Some 1.8
OpenJDK versions are broken (Debian/Ubuntu 1.8.0u40 broken), but some
work (1.8.0u25, FreeBSD).  1.8 should become recommended once working
versions exist in all distributions.

  Driver/hardware dependent, but the Windows Vista/7/8 DirectX 9
  requirement is mostly the same as OpenGL 2.0, so any badged machine
  should have OpenGL 2.0-capable hardware (it will also require a
  functional driver)

†
  Driver/hardware dependent

Support is largely down to the system hardware (GPU) and drivers.
There are no guarantees for 2.0 and greater on Windows (1.4 only
guaranteed), but AMD, Intel and nVidia all provide GL drivers
supporting newer versions.  The minimum baseline is probably 2.1.
However, 3.2/3.3 is probably the baseline for most hardware under 5
years old, with 4.x being the typical baseline for hardware from a
year ago.

Apache 2.2 requires mod_fastcgi (from external repository, for
CentOS6).  Apache 2.4 requires mod_proxy_cfgi and isn't perfectly
supported by default (needs a manual tweak), should be working for
5.1.
