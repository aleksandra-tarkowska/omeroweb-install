Support levels
--------------

The following sections use the terminology in the table below to
describe the support status of a given component, as it progresses
from being new and not supported, to supported and tested on a
routine basis, and to finally being old and no longer supported
nor tested.

general updates) and by OME for OMERO building and server and client
deployment.

XP is now unsupported upstream, and Server 2003 will be unsupported
within the timeframe of 5.1 support.  Vista is likely supported but
usage is minimal and it is untested, hence marked as dropped.  7/Server
2008 and 8/Server 2012 are both supported and used.  Server 2008
builds in place; no 2012 builds or testing in place yet.  No regular
Windows CI deployment and testing is in place other than manually.
Some manual testing on Windows 7 VMs and machines.

Apple do not formally announce end of life for their releases, but 10.6
security fixes ended some time back, and 10.7 has now also ended with
the release of 10.10.  We have regular CI testing of 10.8, 10.9 and
10.10 builds plus developer testing of building and client and server
deployment.  10.6 and 10.7 are marked as dropped since we no longer
use 10.6 internally, and never used 10.7, and they are no longer
tested by the CI infrastructure (all 10.6 and 10.7 nodes retired).

UNIX (FreeBSD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It only really makes sense to support the base toolchain for major
releases and the Ports tree (which is continually updated); these will
be covered in the dependencies, below.

Linux (Centos and RHEL)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only RHEL and CentOS 6 are supported at present.  Given the long life
of enterprise releases, I'd suggest we should only support the latest
one at any given time or else it ties us into very old dependencies;
6.x is already very long in the tooth.  I'd suggest moving to 7 once
it is released and tested by us.  There is extensive CI support for
building and deployment with CentOS 6 but it is not used directly by
developers in general.

Linux (Fedora)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`General overview <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_Release_Life_Cycle>`__

Due to the fast pace of Fedora development, it only really makes sense
to support the current and perhaps the previous release; these will be
covered in the dependencies, below.

Linux (Ubuntu)

Only the LTS and 13.10 releases are supported.  We may wish to only
formally support e.g. the last one or two LTS releases (being a bit
more frequent than CentOS/RHEL); 10.04 has quite old dependencies and
could be considered for dropping.  No CI testing for any version
except 10.04 on howe/gretzky; some developer use of 12.04 LTS, 14.04
LTS and more recent non-LTS releases.

Stable releases 7.x and 6.x are supported.  There is no CI testing for
any version, and some developer use of 7.x.

Linux (Debian testing and unstable)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the fast pace of Debian developement, it only really makes
sense to support the last one or two stable releases; the testing and
unstable requirements will be covered in the dependencies, below.

Hardware support
----------------


Microsoft Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit) for all supported
versions; most systems are today running x64 with most hardware being
x64, but there is still a niche of x86 users, estimated <25% and
falling globally (OMERO usage stats here?)

Unix (MacOS X)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Currently all supported versions are amd64 (64-bit) only.

Unix (FreeBSD)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit) for all supported
releases.  Other platforms are supported, but may require manual
building of prerequisites.

Linux (RHEL and CentOS)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Version 6 supports amd64 (64-bit) and i386 / x86 (32-bit).  Version 7
supports amd64 (64-bit) only.

Linux (other)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Most distributions support i386 / x86 (32-bit) as well, while some
support additional architectures such as 32-bit and/or 64-bit arm and
powerpc.

Additional notes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The OMERO server is de-facto 64-bit-only due to the large memory
requirements; this could safely be made a requirement.  On the client
side, there is a requirement for 32-bit support for Windows clients
and to a lesser extent on Linux, and zero on MacOS X at present.
Dropping 32-bit support for OMERO.server and C++ Ice and other builds
should be considered, given the vast reduction in the support burden
and steadily dropping need for these builds.

Dependencies
------------

The following subsections detail the versions of each dependency
needed by OMERO which are supported by both its upstream developers
(for security and general updates) and by OME for OMERO building and
server and client deployment.

.. note::
    Versions in brackets are in development distributions and may
    change without notice.

Therefore distribution support is not critical since 9.3 and 9.4 are
available for all platforms.

At the moment 2.7 support is present upstream for the foreseeable
future; 3.x versions continue to be released and retired regularly in
parallel.  The limiting factor will be distribution support for 2.7 as
major packages are slowly switching to 3.x, and this might leave us in
a mess if our python module dependencies are no longer available
without major effort.  Ice in particular has dropped 2.7 support for
Windows.

Note that clang++ 3.3 is used in MacOS 10.8 and FreeBSD 10; earlier
versions were not much used as a default compiler and are probably not
worth supporting; 3.4 is used in MacOS X 10.9 and 10.10 and in FreeBSD
10.1. Until 3.4, no point releases were made for major versions.

Note that all distributions provide OpenJDK 6, 7 and 8 due to
distribution restrictions by Oracle.  Oracle Java may be used if
downloaded separately.

Oracle no longer allow general downloading of Java 6.  Java 7 is
available for all platforms except for OSX 10.6 (where it is
installable manually by unpacking the 10.7 installer).  Some 1.8
openjdk versions are broken (Debian/Ubuntu 1.8.0u40 broken), but some
work (1.8.0u25, FreeBSD).

  Driver/hardware dependent, but the Windows Vista/7/8 DirectX 9
  requirement is mostly the same as OpenGL 2.0, so any badged machine
  should have OpenGL 2.0-capable hardware (it will also require a
  functional driver)

†
  Driver/hardware dependent

Support is largely down to the system hardware (GPU) and drivers.  No
guarantees for 2.0 and greater on Windows (1.4 only guaranteed), but
AMD, Intel and nVidia all provide GL drivers supporting newer
versions.  The minimum baseline is probably 2.1.  However, 3.2/3.3 is
probably the baseline for most hardware under 5 years old, with 4.x
being the typical baseline for hardware from a year back.

Apache 2.2 requires mod_fastcgi (from external repository, for
CentOS6).  Apache 2.4 requires mod_proxy_cfgi (`to be tested
