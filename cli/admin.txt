Server administration
---------------------

Server start
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Once your database has been properly configured and your config profile
is set to use that database, you are ready to start your server using the
:omerocmd:`admin start` command::

    $ bin/omero admin start

.. note::

    :omerocmd:`admin start` and :omerocmd:`admin restart` provide a useful
    debugging and maintenance option called :option:`--foreground`. Using
    this option allows for starting the server up in the foreground, that is
    without creating a daemon on UNIX-like systems or service on Windows.
    During the lifetime of the server, the prompt from which it was launched
    will be blocked.

Server diagnostics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    $ bin/omero admin diagnostics
