Database tools
--------------

Rather than try to provide the functionality of a RDBM tool like ``psql``, the
:omerocmd:`db script` command helps to generate SQL scripts for building your
database. You can then use those scripts from whatever tool is most
comfortable for you::

    $ bin/omero db script OMERO4 0 secretpassword
    Using OMERO4 for version
    Using 0 for patch
    Using password from commandline
    Saving to /omero/OMERO4__0.sql
    $ psql omero < OMERO4__0.sql
