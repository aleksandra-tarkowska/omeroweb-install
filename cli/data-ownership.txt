Changing the ownership of data
==============================

As described in :doc:`../server-permissions` every imported plate or
image is in a particular group and owned by a particular user. OMERO
administrators must sometimes move data to a different group and/or give
it to a different user.

.. warning::

  Administrators may move data into a group of which the data owner is
  not a member. Also, administrators may give data to a user who is not
  a member of the data's group. These actions may be reasonable steps in
  a larger workflow but do note the potential to confuse users who find
  that they own data that is not in any of their groups.
