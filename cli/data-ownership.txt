Data management - ownership and move between groups
===================================================

As described in :doc:`../server-permissions` every imported plate or
image is in a particular group and owned by a particular user. OMERO
administrators must sometimes move data to a different group and/or give
it to a different user.

.. warning::

  Data does not need to be assigned to a group where the data owner is
  a member, and administrators may wish to change the ownership of data
  or move it between groups in several steps of a larger workflow. However,
  it is generally expected that data should end up in a group where the
  data owner is a member, so that they can view their
  data in the OMERO clients.
