Example production server set-ups
=================================

Micron, Oxford
--------------

The OMERO server at
`Micron, Oxford <http://www2.bioch.ox.ac.uk/microngroup/micron_home.php>`_
houses two OMERO instances, the databases for both these instances, and a
single OMERO.web instance which serves them both. The second OMERO instance
(Raff OMERO) originated from another group's private OMERO server, which is
now managed by Micron, but there was no way to merge this data into the main
server. The main OMERO instance is configured to interface to a departmental
LDAP server to authenticate users and get initial authorization details.

OMERO Data1 in the diagram is a large filestore server which hosts all the
image data. This is made available to the OMERO server itself via a Samba
mount. This server has 36 TiB of space of which OMERO is using 16 TiB and Raff
OMERO is using 600 GiB. This is backed up to a tape robot.

OMERO Processor1 consists of a 32 core, 128GiB RAM processing machine for
doing image analysis. This is connected on a completely private network to the
OMERO server (to avoid issues with configuring OMERO.grid to be secure) and
runs scripts using OMERO.grid.
