Memory configuration
====================

A number of configuration properties starting with ``omero.mem``
control the calculation of how much memory to allocate to
various OMERO services on startup, most importantly:

* blitz
* indexer
* pixeldata

Configuration properties
------------------------

Configuration properties can either be applied to all three service
types at the same time by omitting the service type (e.g.
:term:`omero.mem.strategy`) or to each individually by including it
(e.g. `omero.mem.blitz.strategy`).


For example, the default, PercentStrategy, is equivalent to making the call:

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.mem.strategy percent

This could be changed to use the ManualStrategy for a single server via:

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.mem.indexer.strategy manual

Strategies
----------

A couple of strategies are available for calculating the effective
JVM settings from the provided configuration properties.

.. glossary::

    PercentStrategy
        Default. Reads the `percent` configuration property which can also be
        set globally or on a service-type basis. This percent (0-100)
        of the system memory is used for the process.
        :term:`omero.mem.use_total`, :term:`omero.mem.min_total`, and
        :term:`omero.mem.max_total` are all used for defining the
        system memory seen. The default percentages are: blitz and
        pixeldata 15%, indexer 10%.


    ManualStrategy
        Simply provides the values given as the JVM settings. If no
        value is set for a particular configuration property, then
        the default is used: heap_size=512m and perm_gen=128m
        These values are equivalent to the defaults in OMERO 5.0.2
        and earlier.

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.mem.blitz.percent 50

would raise the blitz percent to 50.

::

	$ bin/omero config set omero.mem.max_total 24000

would allow an OMERO installation to make use of 24GB
of system memory. With the default of 15%, Blitz would
use 3600MB.

Tips
----

After modifying any memory settings, be sure to restart your server.

::

	$ bin/omero admin restart
