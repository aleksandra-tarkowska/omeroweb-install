System requirements
===================

Hardware
--------

OMERO.server
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The system requirements for OMERO.server vary greatly depending on image
size and number of users. At a minimum we suggest:

-  Single core 1.33GHz Intel or AMD CPU
-  2GB RAM
-  500MB of hard drive space for OMERO.server distribution

The recommended OMERO.server specification we suggest for between 25-50
users is:

-  Quad core 1.33GHz Intel or AMD CPU
-  8GB RAM
-  500MB hard drive space for OMERO.server distribution
-  Hard drive space proportional to the image sizes expected (likely
   between 10 and 100TB)

Hard drive space should be proportional to the image sizes expected. The drive
space should permit **proper locking**, which is often not the case with
remotely mounted shares. See the
:doc:`Unix </sysadmins/unix/server-binary-repository>`
and :doc:`Windows </sysadmins/windows/server-binary-repository>` binary
repository sections for more information.

RAM is not going to scale linearly, particularly with the way the JVM
works. You are probably going to hit a hard ceiling between 4 and 6GB for
JVM size (there is really not much point in having it larger anyway).
With a large database and aggressive PostgreSQL caching your RAM usage
could be larger. Still, even for a large deployment, it is not cost
effective to use more than a few GBs of RAM for this purpose.
:doc:`server-performance` provides information about fine-tuning the
server processes' memory usage. In summary, depending on hardware layout 16,
24 or 32GB of RAM would be ideal for your OMERO server. If you have a separate
database server more than 16GB of RAM may not be of much benefit to you at
all.

CPU is not something that an OMERO system is usually ever limited
by. However, when it is limited, it is almost always limited by GHz and
not by the CPU count. So you are not going to get a huge OMERO
performance increase by, for example, throwing 24 cores at the problem. In
summary, depending on hardware layout 2 × 4, 2 × 6 system core count should be
more than enough.

:doc:`server-setup-examples` provides details on some production set-ups
currently in use by OMERO admins, along with how many users and the amount of
data they support, which you may find helpful.

OMERO.insight and OMERO.importer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The recommended client specification is:

-  Single core 1.33GHz Intel or AMD CPU
-  2GB RAM
-  200MB hard drive space for OMERO.clients distribution

Large imports may require 4GB RAM.

.. _client_directories:

Client configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When performing some operations the clients make use of temporary file
storage and log directories. The table below indicates the default values for
each directory and the environment variables for overriding their locations:

.. list-table::
  :header-rows: 1

  - * Client directory
    * Environment variable
    * Default location (UNIX)
    * Default location (Windows)
  - * OMERO user directory
    * :envvar:`OMERO_USERDIR`
    * :file:`$HOME/omero`
    * :file:`%HOMEPATH%\\omero`
  - * Temporary files
    * :envvar:`OMERO_TMPDIR`
    * :file:`$HOME/omero/tmp`
    * :file:`%HOMEPATH%\\omero\\tmp`
  - * Local sessions
    * :envvar:`OMERO_SESSIONDIR`
    * :file:`$HOME/omero/sessions`
    * :file:`%HOMEPATH%\\omero\\sessions`
  - * Log files
    *
    * :file:`$HOME/omero/log`
    * :file:`%HOMEPATH%\\omero\log`

Note that setting :envvar:`OMERO_USERDIR` will also change the default location
for the temporary files and the local sessions.

If your home directory is stored on a network, possibly NFS mounted (or similar), then these temporary files are being written and read over the
network. This can slow access down.

Software
--------

Each component of the OMERO platform has a separate set of
prerequisites. Where possible, we provide tips on getting started with
each of these technologies, but we can only provide free support within
limits.
