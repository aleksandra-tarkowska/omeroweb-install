OMERO.web Nginx and Gunicorn deployment (Unix/Linux)
====================================================

.. note:: Since OMERO 5.2, the OMERO.web framework no longer bundles
      a copy of the Django package, instead manual installation of
      the Django dependency is required. It is highly recommended to use
      `Django 1.8`_ (LTS) which requires Python 2.7. For more information
      see :ref:`python-requirements` on the
      :doc:`/sysadmins/version-requirements` page.

.. _gunicorn_default_configuration:

Gunicorn default configuration (Unix/Linux)
-------------------------------------------

Install `Django 1.8`_,
`Gunicorn >= 19.3 <http://gunicorn.org>`_
and `futures <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/futures>`_ using package requirements file:

::

   $ pip install -r share/web/requirements-py27-nginx.txt

.. note:: For more details refer to
      :djangodoc:`how to install Django 1.8 <topics/install/#install-the-django-code>`
      or :djangodoc:`upgrade Django to 1.8 <topics/install/#remove-any-old-versions-of-django>`.


Additional settings can be configured by the following properties:

- :property:`omero.web.application_server.max_requests` to 500

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi.workers` (2 x NUM_CORES) + 1

  .. note::
      DO NOT scale the number of workers to the number of clients
      you expect to have. OMERO.web should only need 4-12 worker
      processes to handle many requests per second.

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi.threads` 2-4 x NUM_CORES the number of worker threads
  for handling requests.

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi.args` Additional arguments. For more details
  check `Gunicorn Documentation <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html>`_.

.. _gunicorn_async_configuration:

Gunicorn asyncronious configuration (Unix/Linux)
------------------------------------------------

Install `Django 1.8`_,
`Gunicorn >= 19.3 <http://gunicorn.org>`_
and `Gevent >= 0.13 <http://www.gevent.org/>`_ using package requirements file:

::

   $ pip install -r share/web/requirements-py27-async-nginx.txt

.. note:: For more details refer to
      :djangodoc:`how to install Django 1.8 <topics/install/#install-the-django-code>`
      or :djangodoc:`upgrade Django to 1.8 <topics/install/#remove-any-old-versions-of-django>`.


Additional settings can be configured the following properties:

- :property:`omero.web.application_server.max_requests` to 0

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi.workers` (2 x NUM_CORES) + 1

  .. note::
      DO NOT scale the number of workers to the number of clients
      you expect to have. OMERO.web should only need 4-12 worker
      processes to handle hundreds or thousands of requests per second.

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi.worker_connections` the maximum number
  of simultaneous clients.

- :property:`omero.web.wsgi.args` Additional arguments. For more details
  check `Gunicorn Documentation <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html>`_.


.. _nginx_gunicorn_wsgi_configuration:

Nginx configuration (Unix/Linux)
--------------------------------

If you have installed Nginx, OMERO can automatically generate a
configuration file for your web server. The location of the file
will depend on your system, please refer to your web server's manual.
See :ref:`customizing_your_omero_web_installation_unix`
for additional customization options.

To create a site configuration file for inclusion in a system-wide nginx
configuration redirect the output of the following command into a file:

::

    $ bin/omero web config nginx

.. literalinclude:: nginx-omero.conf

.. note::
    OMERO.web requires ``body_in_file_only`` adjusted in your default nginx
    config because nginx must buffer incoming data. Make sure you have that
    set to the following config:

    ::

        http {
            ...
            sendfile on;
            send_timeout 60s;
            client_max_body_size 0;
            ...
        }

To configure an HTTPS server follow
`the nginx documentation <http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/configuring_https_servers.html>`_.

Running OMERO.web (Unix/Linux)
------------------------------

Start the Gunicorn worker processes listening by default on 127.0.0.1:4080:

::

    $ bin/omero web start
    ... static files copied to '/home/omero/OMERO.server/lib/python/omeroweb/static'.
    Starting OMERO.web... [OK]

The Gunicorn workers are managed **separately** from other OMERO.server
processes. You can check their status or stop them using the
following commands:

::

    $ bin/omero web status
    OMERO.web status... [RUNNING] (PID 59217)
    $ bin/omero web stop
    Stopping OMERO.web... [OK]
    Django WSGI workers (PID 59217) killed.


Download limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to offer users to download data from OMERO.web you have to deploy
using :ref:`gunicorn_async_configuration`.
OMERO.web is able to handle multiple clients on a single worker
thread switching context as necessary while streaming binary data from
OMERO.server. Depends on the traffic and scale of the repository you should
configure connections and speed limits on your server to avoid blocking
resources. We recomand you to run benchmark and test performance.
It is also possible to apply :ref:`download_restrictions` and
offer alternative access to binary data.

.. note::
    Handle streaming request/responses requires proxy buffering
    to turn off. For more details refer to
    `Gunicorn deployment <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/deploy.html>`_.

.. note::
    :property:`omero.web.application_server.max_requests` should be set to 0

.. _nginx_troubleshooting:

Troubleshooting
---------------

In order to identify why OMERO.web is not available run:

::

    $ bin/omero web status

Then consult nginx ``error.log`` and ``OMERO.server/var/log/OMEROweb.log``

OMERO.web runing but status says not started
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you upgraded OMERO but forgot to stop OMERO.web, proceses will be still
runing. In order to kill stale processes by hand, run:

::

    $ ps aux | grep /home/omero/OMERO.server/var/django.pid

.. note::
    As Gunicorn is based on the pre-fork worker model it is enough to kill
    master proces, the one with the lowest PID.


Debbuging
^^^^^^^^^

To run WSGI server in a debug mode set
`Gunicorn logging <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#logging>`_
using :property:`omero.web.wsgi_args`:

::

    $ bin/omero config set omero.web.wsgi_args -- "--log-level=DEBUG --error-logfile=/home/omero/OMERO.server/var/log/error.log".


OMERO.web not available HTTP 404
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Consult nginx error.log for more details.

The most common problem appeares when default configuration for ``location /``
is loaded prior to omeroweb.conf

::

    2016/01/01 00:00:00 [error] 1234#0: *5 "/usr/share/nginx/html/webclient/login/index.html" is not found (2: No such file or directory), client: 1.2.3.4, server: localhost, request: "GET /webclient/login/ HTTP/1.1", host: "1.2.3.4"


OMERO.web not responding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

    [CRITICAL] WORKER TIMEOUT (pid:1234)

OMERO.web deployed with Gunicorn relies on the operating system to provide
all of the load balancing while handling requests. Scale the number of
workers starting with (2 x NUM_CORES) + 1 workers. For more details refer to
`Gunicorn design <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/design.html>`_.
