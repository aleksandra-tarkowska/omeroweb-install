OMERO.server to OMERO.fs migration
==================================


The OME team puts the safety of users' data first. The shift towards the
OMERO.fs paradigm changes the way images are imported and stored. Because of
that migration of an existing pre-OMERO.fs production server to OMERO.fs has
to be performed with caution.

Currently research and testing is being performed into increasing the 
reliability of the migration steps. At present it is not possible to migrate
an OMERO.server from the 4.x line to the OMERO.fs version.
