Configuration properties
========================

The primary form of configuration is via the use of key/value properties,
stored in :file:`etc/grid/config.xml` and read on server startup. Backing up
and copying these properties is as easy as copying this file to a new server
version.

The :source:`etc/omero.properties` file of your distribution defines all the
default configuration properties used by the server. Changes made to the file
are *not* recognized by the server. Instead, the :omerocmd:`config` command is
used to change those properties that you would like to customize.

Examples of doing this are on the main :doc:`Unix <unix/server-installation>`
and :doc:`Windows <windows/server-installation>` pages, as well as the
:doc:`LDAP installation <server-ldap>` page.

Database
--------

.. glossary::

    omero.db.poolsize
        Sets the number of connections to PostgreSQL which
        will be used by OMERO (default is 10)

        Your database installation will need to be configured to accept *at
        least* as many, preferably more, connections as the value of
        "omero.db.poolsize"

.. _ldap_configuration:

LDAP
----

.. _JNDI referrals documentation: http://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/ldap/referral/jndi.html
.. glossary::

  omero.ldap.config
    Enable or disable LDAP (true/false).

  omero.ldap.urls
    Set the URL of the LDAP server.

    .. note::
      A |SSL| URL above should look like this:
      ldaps://ldap.example.com:636

  omero.ldap.username
    Set LDAP server bind DN (if required; can be empty)::

       bin/omero config set omero.ldap.username cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com

  omero.ldap.password
    Set the LDAP server bind password (if required; can be empty)

  omero.ldap.base
    Set the LDAP server base search DN.
    The filter applied to all users; can be empty in which case any LDAP
    user is valid.

  omero.ldap.referral
    Set the LDAP referral options. Defaults to "ignore"; available options are
   "ignore, "follow" or "throw" as per the `JNDI referrals documentation`_)


.. _memory_configuration:

Memory
------

.. glossary::

    omero.mem.strategy
        Selects which memory strategy to use.

    omero.mem.heap_size
        Sets the -Xmx value for the JVM.

    omero.mem.heap_dump
        Toggles on or off heap dumps on OOMs. Default is "off".
        The special value "tmp" will create the heap dumps in
        your temp directory.

    omero.mem.perm_gen
        Sets the MaxPermSize value for the JVM.

    omero.mem.percent
        Used only by the percent strategy. An integer between 0
        and 100 which is the percent of active memory that will
        be used by the service.

    omero.mem.append
        Contains other parameters which should be passed to
        the Java process. The value of "append" is treated
        as if it were on the command-line and so will be
        separated on whitespaces. For example,
        '-XX:-PrintGC -XX:+UseCompressedOops' would result
        in two new arguments.

    omero.mem.max_total
        Maximum amount of active memory that OMERO will
        use subject to use_total. By default, 48 GB.

    omero.mem.min_total
        Minimum amount of memory that OMERO will
        see. By default, 3.4 GB.

    omero.mem.use_total
        Specify how much memory OMERO *thinks* your system has.
        If unset, an attempt will be made to detect the actual
        amount: first by using the Python library `psutil` and
        if that is not installed, by running a Java process. If
        neither works, 4.0 GB is assumed.

.. _search_configuration:

Search
------

.. glossary::

  omero.search.cron

    The automatic indexing will occur at the frequency defined by the
    ``omero.search.batch`` setting (default is ``*/4 * * * * ?``). For
    instance, the following configuration would imply indexing every thirty
    seconds of every hour, day, month, year, etc.::

      $ bin/omero config set omero.search.cron "0,30 * * * * ?"

  omero.search.batch

    The search indexer will process events in batches, the size of which
    is determined by the ``omero.search.batch`` setting (default is 50)::

      $ bin/omero config set omero.search.batch 200

    Setting a larger batch size can potentially speed up indexing, but it also
    places more strain on the indexer heap. If you increase batch size, it
    may be necessary to also increase heap size (see:
    :ref:`out_of_memory_error`).

  omero.search.max_file_size

    The search indexer will not index any text or PDF files larger than
    ``omero.search.max_file_size`` bytes. If a file larger than this is
    attached, e.g. to an image, the indexer will simply ignore the contents of
    the file when creating the search index. To allow larger files to be added
    to the search index you may increase the setting (default is 131072000, or
    125 MB)::

      $ bin/omero config set omero.search.max_file_size 262144000

    .. note:: If you set the max file size to greater than 1/2 the size of the
      indexer's heap (256 MB by default), you may encounter Out of Memory
      errors in the Indexer process or you may cause the search index to
      become corrupt. Be sure that you also increase the heap size accordingly
      (see :ref:`out_of_memory_error`).

.. _sessions_configuration:

Sessions
--------


.. glossary::

    omero.sessions.timeout

        Sets the duration of inactivity in milliseconds after which a login is
        required (default is 600000, or 10 minutes).
